trainsubject: save the subject data of subject_train.txt showing the subject of every row of train.x data.
test.x: save the testing data of X_test.txt
test.y: save the activity data of Y_test.txt
testsubject: save the subject data of subject_train.txt showing the subject of every row of test.x data.
traindata:merge train.y train.x trainsubject into a dataset by column merging
testdata:merge test.y test.x testsubject into dataset by column merging
df: dataframe contains both train and test data merged by row.
featurename: load feature name from features.txt
featureindex: choose features related to mean and standard deviation from featurename
dfex: it has the same data as df dataset, but its variable names and second activity column are changed into more understandable labels.
